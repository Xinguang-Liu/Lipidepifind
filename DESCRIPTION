Description: Lipidepifind is a tool to identify epi-metabolites (structure modifications out of classical bio-pathway)of lipids from biosamlpes. The package contains a predicted lipid epi-metabolite library based on thousands of parent lipids and 94 types of structural modifications. Users can upload rawdata of high-resolution mass spectrometry, and the m/z matching of epimetbolites can be conducted by <Lipid_epimetabolite_matching>. In addition, epi-reaction_enrichment  of Lipid epimetabolite biomarker can be conducted by <epi-reaction_enrichment>, to identify the significantly changed structural modification type of lipids in a disease.
